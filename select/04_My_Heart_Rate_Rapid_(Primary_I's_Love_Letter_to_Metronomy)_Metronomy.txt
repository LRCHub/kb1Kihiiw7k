I've been trying just to get through to you
I've been singing in the RadioShack
It cost a dollar for a song or two
But so far I've heard nothing back

Oh-ooh, it must be love
It must be love
It must be love
It must be
Oh-ooh, it must be love
It must be love
It must be love
It must be

They told me, "Son, if there's one thing to do
You should forget and never look back"
But I'm sick, I'm glued
I'm cemented to you
So what you gonna do 'bout that?
Ha-ha

Oh-ooh, it must be love
It must be love
It must be love
It must be
Oh-ooh, it must be love
It must be love
It must be love
It must be

I've been slowly dying for a week now or two
And it takes me, it takes me back
Midnight request, that was me, that was you
Could you do it, could you take me back?

Oh-ooh, it must be love
It must be love
It must be love
It must be
Oh-ooh, it must be love
It must be love
It must be love
It must be
